# Datasets

Below are two large scale datasets: TR-News (Turkish) and HU-News (Hungarian). These datasets are intended for abstractive text summarization task but also contain other fields which can be useful for other tasks such as topic detection, key phrase extraction and author detection. A second version (deduplicated based on the abstract and content field uniqueness) for both datasets are also provided.
